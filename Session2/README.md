### 1. Software Installations
**This section describes the preparation of software for the hands-on session.**

#### 1.1. Install the Arduino Software on PCs
[ARDUINO IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write acode and upload it to the board. 
Please download and install the software depending on the operating system you ouse.

#### 1.2. (Optional) for Arduino Counterfeit Products.
If you have a [Counterfeit Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Products/Counterfeit) you might need to install FTDI (CH340/CH341) USB to Serial interface.
Please visit the following [Website](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) for the Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers.

### 2. Hardware Verifications
**From this section, we can verify the normal operations of Arduino we'll use throughout the whole sessions.**

#### 2.1. Wiring
